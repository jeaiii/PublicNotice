# Public Notice

## Arbitration Agreements
I hereby give public notice that I do NOT willingly enter into any arbitration agreements unless ALL of the following conditions are met:
- The agreement is a personally negotiated separate contract between myself and the other party
- It does not apply to any acts which may be illegal
- It includes specific monetary compensation for entering into the arbitration agreement
- It does not exclude class action
- It does not require non-disclosure
- It clearly defines the scope and duration limits
- It is physically countersigned by both parties (not digitally signed)

All arbitration clauses contained within other contracts and/or presented for digital signature do NOT meet the above conditions and do NOT have my affirmative acceptance.
All such clauses or agreements are deemed severed, excluded, and/or unenforceable if a valid contract is found to exist in US court.
